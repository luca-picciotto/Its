# Writing Test
## Summarize the text in max 200 words
    The Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) is a metalanguage that gave rise to HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and XML (extensible Markup Language). SGML allows the creation of markup languages, used to structure and format elements of electronic documents.

    HTML is a specific derivation of SGML, mainly used for the presentation of web pages. It is a presentation language that deals with the layout of information rather than the content of the data itself.

    XML, a subset of SGML, is also a metalanguage but focuses on the identity, meaning, and structure of data. It is extensible, allowing developers to define their own custom tags, making the content more intelligent and flexible. This enables search engines to better understand the content of documents.

    XML does not handle data visualization, leaving that task to HTML. However, XML can be used within HTML documents to provide metadata. XML has the potential to revolutionize the web and e-commerce, much like HTML transformed the Internet.
