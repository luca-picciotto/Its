// 2.Digital Age
// ● A Video has the following methods and properties
// * title (a string)
// * seconds (a number)
// * watch(x seconds [optional]) prints "You watched X seconds of 'TITLE'" e.g. "You watched
// 120 seconds of 'Lord of the rings'". If x is missing prints "You watched all SECONDS seconds
// of 'TITLE'" e.g. "You watched all 160 seconds of 'Lord of the rings'"
// ● A MusicVideo extends Video and has these extra methods and properties
// * artist (a string)
// * play() prints "You played 'TITLE' by 'ARTIST'" e.g. "You played 'Another Brick in the Wall' by 'Pink Floyd'"


// ● Use the prototype method, not classes, to write a constructors for Video and
// MusicVideo
// ○ The constructor functions accept a single config object
// ○ All arguments are optional, use defaults if missing
// ● Create an array that contains a mix of Video and MusicVideo instances
// ● Loop on the Array and for each item
// ○ call the watch() method
// ○ call the play() method only if it's a MusicVideo. Hint: Use instanceof
// ● Optional:
// ○ in a new folder, repeat the exercise using the class syntax rather than the prototype method
// ○ All behaviors should be identical
